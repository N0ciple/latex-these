\begin{abstract}
  This chapter addresses the challenge of compressing large neural networks,
  whose time and memory footprints are increasingly high. Although large neural
  networks have shown impressive performances across various domains, they are
  not deployable on embedded devices due to their size. Among the existing
  techniques that yield lightweight neural networks, pruning is a popular
  approach that seeks to reduce the size of neural networks by removing
  redundant or unnecessary weights. However, most of the pruning methods rely on
  saliency indicators that identify removable weights after training without
  considering the targeted pruning rate.\\
  \indent In this chapter, we propose an alternative pruning approach based on
  weight reparametrization. Our method incorporates a budget loss that drives
  sparsity toward the targeted pruning rate during training. The weight
  reparametrisation acts as a mask that soft-prunes the smallest weights, while
  the budget loss serves as a surrogate $\ell_0$ norm that regulates the network
  budget. As a result, our approach significantly mitigates the performance
  drop, induced by pruning, with respect to the unpruned network compared to
  other pruning methods. We demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of our
  method across various pruning rates, datasets, and architectures, including
  Conv4, VGG16, ResNet20 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and ResNet18 on the more
  challenging TinyImageNet dataset.\\
  \indent We also evaluate the effectiveness and relevance of our method in a
  comparative experimental analysis using different settings. Furthermore, we
  evaluate the proposed approach with an already tuned and pruned initialisation
  and show that it outperforms common fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
  our proposed approach is a promising alternative to existing pruning
  techniques, providing an efficient and effective way to reduce the size of
  neural networks while eliminating the need for costly fine-tuning steps.\\

\section{Introduction and Related Work}
% region
Neural networks have disrupted the field of machine learning, leading to
breakthroughs in various areas such as image and speech recognition
\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/KrizhevskySH12,DBLP:journals/corr/SimonyanZ14a,DBLP:conf/cvpr/HeZRS16,DBLP:journals/corr/HannunCCCDEPSSCN14,DBLP:conf/icassp/ChanJLV16,DBLP:conf/icml/AmodeiABCCCCCCD16},
natural language processing
\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/BudzianowskiV19,DBLP:conf/naacl/DevlinCLT19,DBLP:conf/nips/VaswaniSPUJGKP17},
as well as exotic domains like game playing
\cite{silver2016mastering,silver2018general} or molecule folding
\cite{jumper2021highly}. However, the size of neural networks has steadily
increased in recent years, thanks to the availability of powerful \acp{GPU}. The
latter makes possible the training of larger and more complex models. As the
complexity and scale of neural networks have expanded, there has been a
corresponding increase in the computational and memory demands necessary for
their effective training and deployment. Origins of neural network architectures
are rooted in the Rosenblatt Perceptron \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron}, which
is a single-layer feedforward network consisting of only one neuron. Over time,
neural network architectures became more complex and included multiple layers,
known as \ac{MLP} or fully connected network. Then, with the emergence of
\acp{CNN}, the complexity of neural network architectures for image recognition
significantly increased. \acp{CNN} use convolutional layers to automatically and
adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. This
adaptivity allows \acp{CNN} to effectively learn and classify images with high
accuracy. This enhancement in accuracy, however, is accompanied by a rise in
complexity and, notably, a higher number of parameters. Noteworthy \ac{CNN}
architectures typically encompass millions of parameters. For instance, AlexNet
(2012) comprises 60 million parameters \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/KrizhevskySH12}, VGG
networks (2014) is composed of 132 to 143 million parameters
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SimonyanZ14a}, Inception (2014) incorporates 27 million
parameters in its third version \cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/SzegedyLJSRAEVR15} and
ResNet networks (2015) span from 11 to 60 million parameters
\cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/HeZRS16}.\\

The demand for neural networks in embedded applications has been rapidly
increasing in recent years, driven in part by the widespread use of mobile
devices. As these devices have become more advanced and ubiquitous, there has
been a growing need for intelligent applications capable of executing intricate
tasks in various contexts on the said devices. Such complex tasks include object
detection in self-driving cars
\cite{howard2017mobilenets,DBLP:conf/icml/TanL19,DBLP:conf/cvpr/RedmonDGF16,DBLP:conf/nips/RenHGS15,kuutti2020survey},
image and speech recognition in mobile devices
\cite{kim2020review,mcgraw2016personalized}, and text-to-speech models in smart
speakers \cite{arik2017deep,ren2019fastspeech}. These applications require
real-time processing and low power consumption, which are impossible with large
neural networks. Pruning techniques can reduce the size of neural networks,
making them more suitable for deployment on embedded devices while still
maintaining or improving their performance. Methods such as structured
\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/0022KDSG17,DBLP:conf/iccv/LiuLSHYZ17} and unstructured
weight pruning
\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/CunDS89,DBLP:conf/iclr/FrankleC19,DBLP:conf/nips/HanPTD15}
can reduce the number of parameters and \acp{FLOP}, consequently reducing the
network size, memory and power consumption.\\

Pruning is an excellent way to obtain lightweight neural networks because it
reduces the number of parameters in a pre-trained network without the need to
design a new architecture. Instead of starting from scratch, pruning techniques
can be applied to existing architectures, which have been trained and tested on
large-scale datasets. Pruning aims to reduce the number of network parameters by
removing redundant or unnecessary weights from a given network which we will
refer to as the \textit{original network}. It then yields a sparsified and
lightweight version of the latter, hereafter referred to as the \textit{pruned
  network}. Pruning methods can be split into two major categories: \textit{(i)}
unstructured weight pruning, where individual weights of the network are removed
based on their importance, and \textit{(ii)} structured pruning, where entire
columns, rows, channels, filters or even entire parts, such as skip connections
of a residual network \cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/HeZRS16}, are removed. \\


Early pruning methods for shallow networks were proposed in the late 1980s.
Techniques from that area are based on removing the smallest weight connections
\cite{janowsky1989pruning}, introducing a weight scaling factor and the study of
its impact on the loss function \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/MozerS88} or the study of
the sensitivity of the weights based on the gradients
\cite{DBLP:journals/tnn/Karnin90}. The most influential papers of the early
pruning days are Optimal Brain Damage \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/CunDS89} and Optimal
Brain Surgeon
\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HassibiS92,DBLP:conf/nips/HassibiSW93,DBLP:conf/icnn/HassibiSW93}.
The former work focuses on pruning weights based on their impact on the loss,
approximated by its Taylor series, which requires the computation of the Hessian
matrix of the loss. However, computing the hessian matrix is intractable in
practice due to the large number of parameters in the neural networks.
Therefore, \citeauthor{DBLP:conf/icnn/HassibiSW93}
\cite{DBLP:conf/icnn/HassibiSW93} introduced the assumption that the
interactions between the weights are negligible and therefore that the hessian
matrix is diagonal.\\


More recently, pruning regained traction with the work of Han et al.
\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanPTD15}. The authors introduced a three-step pruning
method where the weights are first tuned, then all the weights whose absolute
values are below a certain threshold are removed; and finally, the remaining weights
are fine-tuned. \\


Following this work \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanPTD15}, research efforts stirred
toward structured pruning which consists in removing groups of weights. The
structure of a group can be a simple row or column in a filter, a channel of a
filter, the filter itself or even entire parts. Structured pruning aims to
reshape the network by removing unnecessary and computationally expensive
parts, rather than simply sparsifying weight tensors. This approach focuses
on eliminating parts of the network that have minimal impact on the performance
for the given task. Since the remaining weight tensors are not sparse, speedups
can be achieved with conventional libraries and hardware. In this context, Anwar
et al. \cite{anwar2017structured} proposed a pruning technique on various levels
(channels, kernels and intra-kernel levels), while Li et al.
\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/0022KDSG17} proposed a pruning method at a larger (filter)
level. Network slimming \cite{DBLP:conf/iccv/LiuLSHYZ17} is a streamlined
approach that aims at pruning the most useless channels in the layers preceding
\ac{BN} \cite{DBLP:conf/icml/IoffeS15}. It induces sparsity with $\ell_1$
penalisation of the \ac{BN} scaling factors, each one associated with a
channel. Then channels are removed based on the relative importance of their
associated scaling factor up to a predefined sparsity ratio. More recent works
proposed an automatic policy for pruning, such as \ac{amc}
\cite{DBLP:conf/eccv/HeLLWLH18}, which relies on reinforcement learning with two
interacting agents; the first one iterates over the layers of the architecture
and defines a targeted sparsity, and the second agent implements the targeted
sparsity using channel pruning. The \ac{amc} algorithm is either constrained by
accuracy or efficiency, depending on the reward assigned to the agents. Going
further with the concept of automatic pruning and architecture search,
Ramakrishnan et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/crv/RamakrishnanSN20} adapt $\ell_1$
penalisation from \cite{DBLP:conf/iccv/LiuLSHYZ17} to model the relative
importance of layers, groups of layers or network parts that can be removed.
Following the same line, \cite{DBLP:conf/icml/KangH20} proposed a channel
pruning method based on batch normalisation parameters. The authors introduce
masks that model the likelihood of feature maps being inhibited by the \ac{ReLU}
activation function, thereby not contributing to the evaluation of the
underlying network. These masks are obtained by binarising the cumulative
density function of the Gaussian distribution parameterised by the scaling and
the shift of the BN layer. Masks and BN parameters are updated "end-to-end" with
a gradient estimated using the Gumble Softmax trick
\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/JangGP17}. Authors claim that high accuracy is maintained
after pruning and without fine-tuning. \\



Although convenient to implement in practice, structured pruning imposes a
strong topological prior by removing whole chunks of the original network and
achieves a lower sparsity rate compared to unstructured pruning. On the other
hand, unstructured weight pruning focuses on removing independent weights from
the global structure. As a result, this method is much more flexible and leads
to high sparsity rates and compression ratios. Han et al.
\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanPTD15} introduced a simple yet effective three-step
algorithm for unstructured weight pruning: a first standard training step to
identify the most important connections, a magnitude pruning step to remove
weights with the smallest magnitude (\emph{i.e.}, absolute value) and a final
fine-tuning step to compensate for the loss of accuracy introduced by pruning.
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HanMD15} used the same technique in combination with
quantisation and Huffman coding, achieving a compression ratio of up to 49x for
a VGG16 network. Other methods do not rely on weight magnitude, such as
\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LouizosWK18}, which uses non-negative stochastic gates as a
surrogate $\ell_0$ norm and penalises non-zero weights during training.
Variational Dropout \cite{DBLP:conf/icml/MolchanovAV17} introduces a
multiplicative gaussian noise as an alternative to binary dropout
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1207-0580,DBLP:journals/jmlr/SrivastavaHKSS14} with
an unbound dropout rate. Magnitude pruning regained significant attention after
the publication of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/FrankleC19}; an empirical study in
\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/FrankleC19} shows that large pre-trained networks encompass
subnetworks, called \textit{Lottery Tickets}, whose training with initial
weights taken from the large networks yields comparably accurate classifiers. To
extract the lottery ticket, it is necessary to train the large network up to
convergence, apply magnitude pruning and restore the original values of the
unpruned weights. This Lottery Ticket can then be trained to match the level of
performances of the large network, with at most the same number of epochs
needed. Although remarkable, this result is hardly applicable in practice since
it requires multiple computationally intensive training steps to obtain a
trained sparse subnetwork.\\


These structured or unstructured methods propose different saliency indicators
and pruning criteria that aim at identifying and removing redundant or
unnecessary weights or groups of weights. Removing weights, which is typically
done after the training phase. This approach does not take into account the
final desired model size, or weight budget, during the optimization process. In
other words, the pruning strategy, rather than being integrated into the
training process, is an afterthought. This results in an inefficient process
where the network is first trained with a large number of weights, many of which
are later pruned. This introduces a loss of functional performance - depending on
the task considered - that needs to be compensated for (with the exception of
\cite{DBLP:conf/icml/KangH20}). This is achieved through fine-tuning the sparse
or lightened networks obtained after applying the pruning criterion. Fine-tuning
is a computationally intensive task and requires additional training time
\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanPTD15,DBLP:journals/corr/HanMD15}. Moreover, the amount
of weights pruned is enforced after the initial training, meaning that the final
target size or weight budget is never considered in the optimisation procedure.
Hence the need for a fine-tuning step. \\


In order to address the aforementioned issues, namely the need for a costly
fine-tuning step and the lack of consideration for the final budget, we
introduce a novel weight reparametrisation that learns not only the weights of a
surrogate lightweight network but also its topology. This weight
reparametrisation acts as a regulariser that models the tensor of the parameters
of a network, denoted a \textit{surrogate network}, defined as the Hadamard
product of a weight tensor and an implicit mask. The latter makes it possible to
implement unstructured pruning constrained with a budget loss that precisely
controls the number of non-zero weight connections in the resulting network.
Experiments conducted on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and the TinyImageNet
classification tasks, using standard primary architectures (namely Conv4, VGG16,
ResNet20 and ResNet18), show the ability of our method to train effective
surrogate pruned networks without any fine-tuning.

\section{Pruning with Weight Reparametrisation and Budget Loss}\label{sec:chap1:pruning}
% region : introduction of method
Consider the general case of a multi-layer neural network, denoted as a function
$f$ of two variables: $\theta$ and $X$. Function $f$ embodies the network
topology, which is essentially a computation graph, whose edges values are
determined by $\theta$. More specifically, $\theta$ represents the collection of
weights of the network, with $\theta = \{\mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2, \ldots,
  \mathbf{w}_L\}$ and $L$ denoting the number of layers. Each element
$\mathbf{w}_\ell$ of $\theta$ is a multi-dimensional weight tensor encompassing
$\nu_\ell$ elements, associated with layer $\ell$. The parameter $X$ of $f$
represents the input given to the network. Each input $X$ is associated with a
label $y$, also called ground truth. Each pair $(X,y)$ is an element of a
dataset $\mathcal{D}$, with $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathcal{X} \times
  \mathcal{Y}$. In the latter formulation of $\mathcal{D}$,  $\mathcal{X}$ is the
set of the input data, and $\mathcal{Y}$ is the set of the possible labels. This
functional conception of a neural network can be formally written as:

\begin{equation}
  % \centering
  \begingroup
  \setlength\arraycolsep{0pt}
  f \colon\begin{array}[t]{c >{{}}c<{{}} c}
    \mathbb{R}^{\dim (X)} & \to     & \mathbb{R}^{\dim (y)} \\
    X                     & \mapsto & f(X, \theta)
  \end{array}
  \endgroup
\end{equation}\\

The discrepancy between the output of the neural network and the ground truth
$y_i \in \mathcal{Y}$ is computed with a loss function $\mathcal{L}$, whose
expression depends on the considered task. This loss is then minimised by
updating the parameters $\theta$ of the network, thanks to the backpropagation
algorithm \cite{rumelhart1985learning,rumelhart1986learning} and gradient
descent methods.\\

When used as a loss function, the $\ell_0$ norm is perfectly suited for pruning
a network by, on the one hand, acting as a sparsity-inducing regulariser for the
weights ($\theta$), and on the other hand, by indicating the number of non-zero
weights in the network, which is useful for computing the weight budget. \\

We aim to propose an end-to-end method that fits into the backpropagation
framework. Therefore, adding a $\ell_0$ regulariser and a $\ell_0$ based weight budget
is not possible since $\ell_0$ norm is not differentiable. Thus, we propose our
differentiable reparametrisation, which seeks to define a novel weight
expression related to magnitude pruning
\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/CunDS89,DBLP:conf/nips/HanPTD15}. This expression
corresponds to the Hadamard product involving a weight tensor and a function
applied entry-wise to the same tensor (as shown in
\cref{fig:chap1:comparison_reparam_vs_mag_pruning}). This function acts as a
mask that \emph{(i)} multiplies weights by soft-pruning factors which capture their
importance and \emph{(ii)} pushes less important weights to zero through a particular
budget added to the loss function $\mathcal{L}$. \\

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=12.5cm]{chapter_1/assets/comparison_reparam_vs_mag_pruning.pdf}}
  \caption{Comparison of our method and magnitude pruning. Magnitude pruning
    does not include any prior on weights during the initial training phase and
    needs an additional fine-tuning procedure. Our method embeds a saliency
    heuristic based on the weight magnitude in the weight reparametrisation and
    does not require fine-tuning. Best viewed in colour.}
  \label{fig:chap1:comparison_reparam_vs_mag_pruning}
\end{figure}


Our proposed framework allows for joint optimisation of the network weights and
topology. On the one hand, it prevents situations where, because of excessively
pruning a layer, the output from layer $\ell$ of the network is no longer
transmitted to layer $\ell+1$, a scenario we refer to as \emph{disconnections}.
These disconnections can lead to degenerate networks with an irrecoverable
performance drop. Due to these disconnections, the network output becomes
entirely uncorrelated with the input, and it becomes impossible to update the
weights located upstream of this disconnection. On the other hand, our framework
allows reaching a targeted pruning budget in a more convenient way than $\ell_1$
regularisation (see \cref{sec:chap1:impact_of_budget_loss}). Our
reparametrisation also helps minimising the discrepancy between the original and
the surrogate networks by maintaining competitive performances without
fine-tuning. Learning the surrogate network requires only one step that achieves
pruning as a part of network design. This step zeroes out the targeted number of
connections by constraining their reparametrised weights to vanish.

% endregion: introduction of method

\subsection{Weight Reparametrisation}
\label{sec:chap1:weight_reparam}
% region: weight reparam

We consider the original network $f$ as a stack of $L$ layers. The global
expression of $f$ can be recursively defined by the application of the layer
$\ell$ to the output of the layer $\ell-1$. Without a loss of generality, we
omit the bias for clarity. This expression is shown in
\cref{eqn:chap1:layer_eq_f}.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:layer_eq_f}
  f(\mathbf{x}) = g_L \big(\mathbf{w}_L \cdot g_{L-1}(\mathbf{w}_{L-1} \cdot g_{L-2} \dots
  \mathbf{w}_2 \cdot g_1(\mathbf{w}_1 \cdot \mathbf{x}))\big),
\end{equation}
\noindent with $g_\ell$ being a nonlinear activation associated to $\ell \in
  \left\{ 1,\dots, L \right\}$ and $\left\{ \mathbf{w}_\ell \right\}_\ell$
denoting a set of weight tensors where each tensor is associated with a specific
layer $\ell$ in the network. Keeping the same topology but changing the values
of the weight, we now consider the surrogate network $\hat{f}$ with weights
$\{\mathbf{\hat{w}}_\ell\}_\ell$. \Cref{eqn:chap1:layer_eq_f} can be rewriten as
\cref{eqn:chap1:layer_eq_f_hat}. The activation function and the topology of $f$
and $\hat{f}$ are the same. Only the weights are updated.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:layer_eq_f_hat}
  \hat{f}(\mathbf{x}) = g_L \big(\mathbf{\hat w}_L \cdot g_{L-1}(\mathbf{\hat w}_{L-1} \cdot g_{L-2}
  \dots\mathbf{\hat w}_2 \cdot g_1(\mathbf{\hat w}_1 \cdot \mathbf{x}))\big).
\end{equation}

\noindent In the above equation, $\mathbf{\hat w}_\ell$ is referred to as
\textit{apparent weight}, which is a reparametrisation of $\mathbf{w}_\ell$ that
includes a prior on its saliency. An apparent weight $\mathbf{\hat w}_\ell$ of
$\hat{f}$ is derived from a \emph{latent weight} $\mathbf{w}_\ell$ by applying the
following reparametrisation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:reparam}
  \mathbf{\hat w}_\ell = \mathbf{w}_\ell  \odot h_t(\mathbf{w}_\ell),
\end{equation}
\noindent with $h_t$ being the reparametrisation function and $t$ its
temperature parameter (see \cref{eqn:chap1:h_star_expression}). Here, $\odot$
represents the Hadamar product. It means that it is element-wise, and every
single weight has its own reparametrisation. This reparametrisation function
enforces the prior that the smallest weights should be removed from the network
and act as a surrogate $\ell_0$ norm for the budget loss (see
\cref{sec:chap1:budget_loss}). In order to achieve this objective, $h_t$ should
exhibit four properties: \\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\forall x \in \mathds{R},~~ 0 \leq h_t(x) \leq 1 $
  \item $h_t(x) \in C^1 \text{ on } \mathds{R}$
  \item $h_t(x) = h_t(-x)$
  \item $\forall a,\varepsilon \in\mathds{R}^{+\ast},~ \exists ~t
          \in\mathds{R}^{+\ast} ~ | ~ h_t(x) \leq \varepsilon, x \in [-a,a]$
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{First Property - Constrained Image} \\
\begin{equation}
  \centering
  \forall x \in \mathds{R},~~ 0 \leq h_t(x) \leq 1
  \label{eqn:chap1:reparam_prop1}
\end{equation}
\\
There should not be any co-adaptation between the weights and their
reparametrisation. In other words, the reparametrisation function should only
act as a means to select or not the weight. It should not act as a scaling
factor for the latent weight and scale it so that the apparent weight becomes
larger than the latent weight. Constraining the image prevents the value of the
weights from increasing rapidly to compensate for the removal of the smallest
weights. Finally, the apparent weights should have the same sign as the latent
weights. That is why the image of $\mathbb{R}$ by $h_t$ should be the segment
$[0,1]$.\\

\noindent\textbf{Second Property - Differentiability} \\
\begin{equation}
  \centering
  h_t(x) \in C^1 \text{ on } \mathds{R}
  \label{eqn:chap1:reparam_prop2}
\end{equation}
\\
Our method should fit in the backpropagation framework \cite{rumelhart1986learning}. Since the optimisation will
be achieved by gradient descent, the reparametrisation function should be
differentiable to ensure a computable gradient.\\

\noindent\textbf{Third Property - Symmetry} \\

\begin{equation}
  \centering
  h_t(x) = h_t(-x)
  \label{eqn:chap1:reparam_prop3}
\end{equation}
\\
The reparametrisation function should not induce any bias toward the positive or
negative weights so that only their magnitudes matter. It implies that the
reparametrisation function should be symmetric.\\


\noindent\textbf{Fourth Property - Upper Bounded Segment} \\

\begin{equation}
  \centering
  \forall a,\varepsilon \in\mathds{R}^{+\ast},~ \exists ~t
  \in\mathds{R}^{+\ast} ~ | ~ h_t(x) \leq \varepsilon, x \in [-a,a]
  \label{eqn:chap1:reparam_prop4}
\end{equation}
\\
The last property ensures the existence of a temperature parameter $t$, which
allows upper-bounding the response of $h_t$ on any interval for any arbitrary
$\varepsilon$. More formally, for any arbitrarily large $a$ and arbitrarily
small $\varepsilon$, it exists a temperature $t$ which guarantees that the
$h_t(x)$ is smaller than $\varepsilon$, provided that $x$ is in the segment
$[-a, a]$. Hence, $h_t$ acts as a band-stop filter, eliminating the smallest
weights where the parameter $t$ controls the width of that filter.
\Cref{fig:chap1:reparam_funct_varying_t} shows the impact of $t$ on the shape of
the function, more precisely on the width of its pit, when the expression of
$h_t$ is set using \cref{eqn:chap1:stable_h_expression}.\\

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[$h_{t}$ with $t=1$ and varying $n$]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{chapter_1/assets/reparam_funct_varying_n.pdf}
    \label{fig:chap1:reparam_funct_varying_n}} \subfloat[$h_{t}$ with $n=2$
    and varying $t$]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{chapter_1/assets/reparam_funct_varying_t.pdf}
    \label{fig:chap1:reparam_funct_varying_t}} \caption{
    Reparametrisation function $h_t$ with varying temperature parameter $t$ and
    power $n$. $t$ controls the width of the pit, and $n$ controls the steepness
    of the slope.}
  \label{fig:stopband}
\end{figure}

Weight distribution varies tremendously from one layer to another. In order to
match a specific budget (see \cref{sec:chap1:budget_loss}), the width of the
stopband, controlled by $t$, is tuned according to the weight distribution of
each layer. The manual setting of this parameter is non-trivial and cumbersome,
so in practice, $t$ is learned as a part of gradient descent on a layer-by-layer
basis.\\

Considering the aforementioned four properties of $h_t$, a simple choice of that
function is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:h_star_expression}
  h_t^*(x) = \exp\bigg\{{-\displaystyle\frac{1}{(tx)^n}}\bigg\}, ~ n\in 2\mathds{N},
\end{equation}
\noindent where $n$ controls the crispness of $h_t^*$. $n$ is not considered as
a parameter of $h_t$ (or $h_t^*$) since we use a fixed value for our experiments
(\cref{sec:chap1:experiments}), whereas $t$ is a learnt parameter and varies
from one layer to another. \Cref{fig:chap1:reparam_funct_varying_n} shows the
impact of n on the general sharpness of the function. Although the function
described in \cref{eqn:chap1:h_star_expression} satisfies the four above
properties, in practice, $h_t^*$ suffers from numerical instability as it
generates \ac{nan} outputs in most of the widely used deep learning frameworks.
Due to the way backpropagation works, a single \ac{nan} in a weight tensor makes
the whole optimisation process for the entire network no longer possible. We
consider instead a stabilised variant with similar behaviour, as
\cref{eqn:chap1:h_star_expression},  that still satisfies the four above
properties. This numerically stable variant is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:stable_h_expression}
  h_t(x) = C_1 \biggl( \text{exp} \bigg\{-\displaystyle\frac{1}{(tx)^n +1}\bigg\} - C_2 \biggr),
\end{equation}
\noindent with $C_1=\frac{1}{1-e^{-1}}$ and $C_2 = e^{-1}$.\\

The addition of the scalar value 1 at the denominator in
\cref{eqn:chap1:stable_h_expression} is a way to achieve numerical stability. In
\cref{eqn:chap1:h_star_expression}, the denominator $(tx)^n$ has the potential
to approach very small values that result in numerical instabilities, leading to
\ac{nan} outputs. The addition of 1 to the denominator makes the function
numerically stable and avoids producing \ac{nan} outputs. This solution is
favoured over adding a small value, such as an arbitrarily small $\varepsilon$,
as the latter requires careful consideration of its magnitude and may result in
either dramatic alterations to the shape of the function or continued numerical
instability if not carefully chosen. The addition of the value 1 to the
denominator provides a straightforward and sufficient mean to stabilise the
function. Constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are introduced to compensate for the slight
alterations to the shape of the function caused by the addition of 1 to the
denominator, and thus, to ensure that the first property
(\cref{eqn:chap1:reparam_prop1}) is satisfied. Although both $h_t^*$ and $h_t$
satisfy the four properties, they do not have the exact same shapes, as
illustrated in figure (\ref{fig:chap1:h_stable_vs_unstable}).\\

\subsection{Budget Loss}
\label{sec:chap1:budget_loss}
% region: budget loss
Most of the traditional pruning methods in deep learning do not explicitly
incorporate the targeted weight budget during optimisation. The amount of
weights pruned is typically enforced post-training, which may lead to suboptimal
results compared to methods that consider the weight budget during optimisation.
Our method introduces a budget loss term, in addition to the main task loss
term, that drives the network to match and satisfy a given weight budget during
the training process. Consequently, the trained network can be pruned to the
desired pruning rate with a marginal loss in performance without fine-tuning.\\


The considered budget is weight-based and should quantify the targeted fraction
of active connections in the network. To build the budget loss, we first
introduce a cost function that quantifies the number of active connections in
the network. Let $C(\{\mathbf{w}_1,\dots, \mathbf{w}_L\})$ be the {\em observed}
cost associated to a neural network and $C_\text{target}$ the {\em targeted}
one. $C_\text{target}$ is the number of connections that should be active at the
end of the training procedure. The budget loss is defined as \\

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:simple_budget}
  {\cal L}_\text{budget} = \bigl( C(\{\mathbf{w}_1,\dots, \mathbf{w}_L\}) - C_\text{target} \bigr)^2.
\end{equation} \\


\noindent This budget loss is combined with the main task loss (a classification
loss in our experiments - see \cref{sec:chap1:experiments}). The budget loss $
  {\cal L}_\text{budget}$ is quadratic in order to ensure the minimisation of the
difference between the {\em observed} and the {\em targeted} costs. For better
conditioning of this combination, we normalise the budget loss by
$C_\text{initial}$. The latter corresponds to the cost of the original unpruned
network, which is set in practice to the number of its parameters (see also
\cref{sec:chap1:experiments}). Hence, \cref{eqn:chap1:simple_budget} is updated
as:\\

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:real_budget}
  {\cal L}_\text{budget} = \biggl( \displaystyle\frac{C(\{\mathbf{w}_1,\dots, \mathbf{w}_L\}) - C_\text{target}}{C_\text{initial}} \biggr)^2.
\end{equation}\\

Finally, the two losses are combined together via a strictly positive mixing
hyperparameter $\lambda$ that controls the relative importance of the budget loss
${\cal L}_\text{budget}$ compared to the main task loss ${\cal L}_\text{task}$,
leading to\\

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:globalloss}
  {\cal L} =  {\cal L}_\text{task} + \lambda \cdot {\cal L}_\text{budget}.
\end{equation} \\

Ideally, the budget of a neural network could be evaluated as the number of
multiply-add operations, often referred to as \acp{FLOP} or
\acp{MAC}\footnote{The number of \ac{MAC} operations  or \acp{FLOP} for a layer
  cannot be fully determined by its number of parameters since it is heavily
  dependent on the input size. More details are given in
  \cref{sec:appendix:macs}}, needed for a forward pass or through the $\ell_0$
norm of its weights. However, neither are known to be differentiable and,
therefore, cannot be used in a gradient-based optimisation. In order to
circumvent these limitations, we use our weight reparametrisation as a surrogate
measure of $\ell_0$, and we define the cost function as in
\cref{eqn:chap1:cost_function}. In what follows, for the sake of conceptual
simplicity, we will adopt a conventional approach where multidimensional tensors
are referenced using a singular index $i$, in addition to the layer index
$\ell$, effectively vectorising these entities for ease of manipulation. \\

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:cost_function}
  C(\{\mathbf{w}_1,\dots, \mathbf{w}_L\}) = \displaystyle \sum_{\ell=1}^{L} \sum_{i=1}^{\nu_\ell} h_t(w_{\ell i}).
\end{equation} \\


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[Number of parameters]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{chapter_1/assets/vgg16_num_params_per_layer.pdf}

    number of parameters and normalisation factor per layer for a VGG16
    network. The significant differences in terms of the number of parameters
    yields dramatically different normalisation factors. Some of them are 4
    orders of magnitude apart, and all of them are vanishingly small compared
    to a common main task loss value.}
  \label{fig:chap1:vgg16_per_layer_param_and_norm_factor}
\end{figure}

One may argue that the cost should be normalised layer-wise and, therefore,
that the right-hand term of \cref{eqn:chap1:cost_function} should be written as

$$\displaystyle\sum_{\ell=1}^{L}\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{\nu_\ell}
    h_t(w_{\ell i})}{\nu_\ell}$$

However, the number of elements in a layer greatly varies from one to another
(as displayed in \cref{fig:chap1:vgg16_per_layer_param_and_norm_factor}). As a
result,  the budget loss relative importance would vary from one layer to
another. More importantly, the optimisation process would have less incentive to
introduce sparsity in larger layers since their normalisation factor would make
the budget loss negligible compared to other layers or the main task loss. This
is critical since the large layers are generally the ones where the highest
pruning rates can be achieved \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2202-12002}.
Regarding the aforementioned reasons, a better alternative is to normalise by
the initial cost $C_\text{initial}$, as done in \cref{eqn:chap1:real_budget}.\\

\section{Method and Algorithm Overview}
\label{sec:chap1:overview}
% region : overview 
Our method is a combination of a weight reparametrisation and a budget loss,
both described in the previous sections. The two are combined in a global method
that can be used in a standard training procedure using gradient descent. Once
the neural network trained using the method detailed in
\cref{sec:chap1:pruning}, we proceed to prune the smallest weights, w.r.t. their
magnitude, to match and enforce the predetermined targeted budget. During this
stage, we set the smallest weights to zero until the budget requirement is met.
This process is referred to as \textit{effective pruning}.\\

In
\cref{sec:chap1:performances,sec:chap1:impact_of_lambda,sec:chap1:impact_of_reparametrisation,sec:chap1:impact_of_budget_loss}
our results are obtained after following this procedure, which is described in
\cref{alg:chap1:training_pruning}. In other words, the network is first trained
with our reparametrisation and our budget loss, then the \textit{effective
  pruning} step is applied, and finally, the performance is evaluated. In
\cref{sec:chap1:impact_of_fine_tuning}, we assess the performance of our method
with an already trained and pruned initalisation. In this precise setup, since
the initialisation is already pruned to match the targeted budget, the
\emph{effective pruning} step is not needed and thus not applied.\\

  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


The reader can grasp a better understanding of the key differences of our method
compared to the standard pruning pipeline that applies to most pruning methods,
not only magnitude pruning method, by looking at
\cref{fig:chap1:pruning_pipeline_comparison}. It highlights the fact that the
targeted pruning rate is taken into account from the beginning thanks to the
budget loss, and therefore, the network does not need a fine-tuning step after
the \emph{effective pruning} step. On the contrary, the standard pruning
pipeline applies the \emph{pruning criterion} and the \emph{effective pruning}
after the initial training. This results in a drop in performance that needs to
be compensated for with fine-tuning. \\

% region : experiments
% region: introduction of the experiments
In this section, we will study the effectiveness of our method for compressing
\aclp{CNN} image classification models, as well as its impact on accuracy. To
that extent, we will review the impact of both our reparametrisation and our
budget loss. To that extent, we use three reference databases in the field of
computer vision: CIFAR-10 \cite{CIFARdataset}, CIFAR-100 \cite{CIFARdataset}, and
TinyImageNet \cite{TinyImageNet}. We will evaluate the impact of our method on
several neural network architectures: VGG16
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SimonyanZ14a}, Conv4 \cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/FrankleC19},
ResNet18, and ResNet20 \cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/HeZRS16}. \\

\subsection{Performances}
\label{sec:chap1:performances}
% region: performances
Performances of our method are evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with Conv4,
VGG16 and ResNet20. On TinyImageNet, we evaluate our method on ResNet18. We
compare our method against magnitude pruning \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanPTD15}. The
key differences between our method and magnitude pruning are the following:
$(i)$ our method uses a budget loss to encourage sparsity, which takes into
account the final pruning rate from the beginning of the training process,
$(ii)$ our method does not require fine-tuning after pruning. Because of the
latter, we compare our method against magnitude pruning with and without
fine-tuning. Both methods share the following setup: networks are trained during
300 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.1. A {\em Reduce On Plateau}
policy is applied to the learning rate: if the validation accuracy is not
improving for 10 epochs in a row, then the learning rate is decreased by a
factor of 0.3. A weight decay is applied on the weights with a penalisation
factor of $5\times10^{−5}$. This value is lower than the more conventional value
of $1\times10^{-4}$, because we want some weights to be able to drift away from the
origin, and therefore, escape from the pit of $h_t$. An Early Stopping policy was
used to stop the training prematurely if no improvement in the test accuracy is
observed in 60 epochs. To keep the comparison fair, for magnitude pruning, the
300 epochs are split into two phases: the first 150 epochs are dedicated to the
training of the network, and the last 150 epochs are used for fine-tuning the
pruned network. In the fine-tuning phase, the learning rate is divided by 100
for better convergence. \\

Results are reported on
\cref{fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_conv4,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_resnet20,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_vgg16}.
In these figures, our method (denoted \emph{Ours}) is compared to magnitude
pruning with and without fine-tuning (denoted \emph{MP w/ FT} and \emph{MP w/o
  FT}, respectively). All three methods are evaluated on the test fold of the
dataset once the network has been pruned up to the pruning rate indicated on the
\emph{x-axis}. The test accuracy is reported on the \emph{y-axis} as a float
between 0 and 1 (0 being all images wrongly classified and 1 being all images
correctly classified). Each solid line representing a method is the mean of 5
independent runs. The coloured area surrounding the solid line represents the
standard deviation. In addition to the three methods, the dashed lines represent
the performances of an unpruned network trained without weight reparametrisation
and budget loss (denoted \emph{baseline}) and the accuracy of our method before
the effective pruning (denoted \emph{Ours (pre pruning)}), i.e. before we set
the smallest weight, w.r.t. their magnitude, to zero. Sub-figures (c) and (d) of
\cref{fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_conv4,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_resnet20,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_vgg16}.
represents the number of epochs (\emph{y-axis}) needed to obtain the best model
for each method, depending on the pruning rate (\emph{x-axis}).\\


Overall, our method performs consistently better than magnitude pruning without
fine-tuning (\emph{MP w/o FT}) and, for almost all pruning rates, better than
magnitude pruning with fine-tuning (\emph{MP w/ FT}) on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets. In particular, our method significantly outperforms magnitude pruning
in both setups (with and without fine-tuning) for Conv4 networks (cf.
\cref{fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_conv4_cifar10}). For the VGG16 network, we
observe the same trend, although the difference is less significant. For
ResNet20, magnitude pruning slightly overtakes our method on CIFAR-100 for
high pruning rates (more than 90\%).
\Cref{fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_conv4_cifar10_epochs,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_conv4_cifar100_epochs,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_vgg16_cifar10_epochs,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_vgg16_cifar100_epochs,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_resnet20_cifar10_epochs,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_resnet20_cifar100_epochs}
show that our method requires an equivalent number of epochs compared to
magnitude pruning for a higher level of performance (\textit{i.e.} a higher test
accuracy). Magnitude pruning requires fewer epochs than our method, only at high
pruning rates (more than 90\%). On TinyImageNet
(\cref{fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_resnet18}), our method outperforms magnitude
pruning with and without fine-tuning including at very high pruning rates
(95\%). In all scenarios
(\cref{fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_conv4,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_vgg16,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_resnet20,fig:chap1:reparam_vs_mpft_resnet18}),
our method produces much more stable results, and variations from one run to
another are significantly smaller than the ones in magnitude pruning. Indeed,
the combination of the reparametrisation and the budget loss act, on the one
hand, as a regulariser and, on the other hand, helps to prepare the network for
the effective pruning step.\\

\subsection{Optimal Value of \texorpdfstring{$\lambda$}{Lambda}}
\label{sec:chap1:impact_of_lambda}

% region: lambda value

Our method relies on a budget loss whose relative importance compared to the
main task loss is controlled by a parameter $\lambda$ (cf.
\cref{eqn:chap1:globalloss}). The choice of this parameter is crucial to ensure
a good tradeoff between \emph{(i)} adhering to the budget constraint, which
ensures that the weights set to zero during the effective pruning step are
already vanishingly small if the constraint is satisfied. This implies that
zeroing these weights will have a minimal impact on performance; and \emph{(ii)}
the optimisation of the main task loss, which directly impacts the final
performance. The achieved budget as a function of the parameter $\lambda$ is
shown for different pruning rates in
\cref{fig:chap1:lambda_impact_pruning_90,fig:chap1:lambda_impact_pruning_95,fig:chap1:lambda_impact_pruning_99}.
In these figures, the achieved budget is computed as the sum of the weights
reparametrisation divided by the number of weights in the original network.\\

For low pruning rates (\cref{fig:chap1:lambda_impact_pruning_90}), a relatively
low value of $\lambda$ does not guarantee adherence to the budget constraint and
the final network has a smaller achieved budget than the targeted one.
Similarly, for higher pruning rates (\cref{fig:chap1:lambda_impact_pruning_99}),
a low value of $\lambda$ results in a budget in excess compared to the targeted
one. In both cases, the performances of networks trained with a low value of
$\lambda$ are subpar compared to higher values, as reported in
\cref{tab:chap1:lambda_impact}. In contrast to low values of $\lambda$, high
values might lay too much emphasis on the budget loss, and the network
performances are negatively impacted, even though the budget is satisfied or
almost satisfied. This is especially the case for a pruning rate of 99\% for
values of $\lambda \geq 50$ and a pruning rate of 95\% associated with
$\lambda=500$. Following the abovementioned observations, we set the value of
$\lambda$ to 5 for all the experiments. This value strikes the best balance
between the two objectives: budget loss and main task loss. Note that various
scheduling for $\lambda$ have been considered, but they do not significantly
improve performance (see \cref{sec:appendix:annihilation}).

\subsection{Impact of the Budget Loss}
\label{sec:chap1:impact_of_budget_loss}

% region: budget impact

In order to establish the importance and the effectiveness of the budget loss in our
method, we present in this section the results of a comparative experimental
analysis with alternative variants.  Specifically, we investigated the impact of
the budget loss by comparing it with two other variants: \emph{(i)} a variant
where the budget loss is removed, and \emph{(ii)} a variant where the budget
loss is replaced with a regularisation loss based on the $\ell_1$ norm of the
network weights. In order to remove the budget loss, the value of $\lambda$ is set to
zero 0 in \cref{eqn:chap1:globalloss}. In the second variant, we varied the
mixing coefficient $\lambda$ between 0.1 and 100. Considering the same issue of
loss conditioning as in \cref{sec:chap1:budget_loss}, the $\ell_1$ norm is divided
by the total number of parameters, denoted $N$, before being added to the global loss. This
specific global loss is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:chap1:globalloss_l1}
  \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{task} + \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\ell=1}^{L} || \mathbf{w}_\ell ||_1
\end{equation}

Where $||~.~||_1$ represents the $\ell_1$. Values of $N$ for most of the used
architectures are reported in \cref{tab:intro:networks_size}.\\

In both variants, the reparametrisation is kept in order to isolate the impact
of the budget loss. We evaluated the performance of our approach and the two
variants on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets using Conv4, VGG16, and ResNet20
networks. The results are presented in
\cref{fig:chap1:no_budget_conv4,fig:chap1:no_budget_resnet20,fig:chap1:no_budget_vgg16}.
In the figures mentioned above, the variant without the budget loss is denoted
\emph{w/o budget}, and the variant with a $\ell_1$ regularisation loss is
referred to as \emph{$\ell_1$ reg.}. The results denoted \emph{w/ budget}
represents our method in the same setup as in \cref{sec:chap1:performances}.\\

Removing the budget loss (variant \emph{(i)} - \emph{w/o budget}) negatively
impacts the network performances. The test accuracy is systematically lower than
the one obtained with the budget loss. This is particularly visible in
\cref{fig:chap1:no_budget_conv4_cifar100,fig:chap1:no_budget_vgg16_cifar100}.
Removing the budget loss does not push the optimisation to introduce sparsity,
let alone to respect the targeted budget. Since sparsity was not introduced
beforehand, the effective pruning step has a negative impact on the network
performance. Indeed, the latter was not trained with a prior on either targeted
sparsity or targeted budget, embedded in the loss.\\


Replacing the budget loss with a $\ell_1$ regularisation loss (variant
\emph{(ii)} - \emph{$\ell_1$ reg.}) also impacts negatively the performance,
with the exception of the ResNet20 network
(\cref{fig:chap1:no_budget_resnet20}). Although performances are generally worse
than our method (\emph{w/ budget}), results indicate that the mixing coefficient
$\lambda$ has major importance. Indeed, the $\ell_1$ regularisation does not
target a precise budget, however, it still helps optimisation to introduce
sparsity in the network. Thus, for certain pruning rates, the variant
\emph{(ii)} can exhibit better results than our method (especially visible on
\cref{fig:chap1:no_budget_resnet20_cifar10,fig:chap1:no_budget_resnet20_cifar100}).
Nevertheless, the choice of $\lambda$ is critical and not trivial. Because of
the absence of a budget loss, the optimisation does not take any targeted level
of sparsity into account. The tradeoff between optimising the main task loss and
the $\ell_1$ regularisation loss is to be controlled only by the parameter
$\lambda$, which makes it difficult to find a single value suited for a large
range of pruning rates, networks and datasets. Since variant \emph{(ii)} does
not target any specific sparsity, in
\cref{fig:chap1:no_budget_conv4,fig:chap1:no_budget_vgg16,fig:chap1:no_budget_resnet20},
we vary the pruning rate to examine the performance of trained networks at
various sparsity levels.\\

In contrast, our method is able to achieve good performance across multiple and
diverse conditions, without the need to fine-tune the value of $\lambda$.
Experiments presented in this section reveal that the budget loss is a critical
component of the method to train networks and prune them while introducing a
minimal impact on the performance if no fine-tuning is applied. While the
$\ell_1$ regularisation loss may achieve superior performance in certain cases,
our method is simpler to implement since it does need to search for a value of
$\lambda$ per architecture, and more robust in its applicability across various
scenarios.\\

\subsection{Impact of the Reparametrisation}
\label{sec:chap1:impact_of_reparametrisation}

% region: reparam impact

The proposed method comprises two primary components: budget loss and weight
reparametrization. The previous section establishes the significance of the
budget loss in achieving optimal performance. In this section, we study the
impact of incorporating weight reparametrisation. To establish the necessity of
weight reparametrisation, we compare our approach with a variant where the
budget loss is applied but the weight reparametrisation is not. This variant is
denoted \emph{budget only} in the following. The objective of this variant and
the comparison is to isolate the impact of weight reparametrization. The budget
loss is calculated in the same way as described in \cref{sec:chap1:budget_loss}.
The budget computation uses our reparametrisation function but it does not need
the weight to be reparametrised, since the budget is computed on the latent
weight $\mathbf{w}$ and not the reparametrised weights $\mathbf{\hat{w}}$.\\


We evaluate the performance of our method and the \emph{budget only} variant on
Conv4, ResNet20, and VGG16 networks using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets (see
\cref{fig:chap1:budget_only_conv4,fig:chap1:budget_only_resnet20,fig:chap1:budget_only_vgg16}).
Both the proposed approach and \emph{budget only} variant are trained with the
same hyperparameters. For the \textit{budget only} variant,  we perform
%TODO: changer la valeur de 500 en 50.
experiments by varying the mixing coefficient $\lambda$ from 0.5 to 500. The
performances did not vary significantly w.r.t. $\lambda$, suggesting that the
mixing coefficient does not have a significant impact on the performance.
Therefore, in order to ensure the clarity of
\cref{fig:chap1:budget_only_conv4,fig:chap1:budget_only_resnet20,fig:chap1:budget_only_vgg16},
we only display the results for $\lambda = 5$.\\

\Cref{fig:chap1:budget_only_conv4,fig:chap1:budget_only_resnet20,fig:chap1:budget_only_vgg16}
present the results of the performance comparison. Our method is denoted as
\emph{budget + reparam} and is evaluated after pruning, whereas the \emph{budget
  only} variant results are presented both before and after pruning. On Conv4 and
VGG16 (\cref{fig:chap1:budget_only_conv4,fig:chap1:budget_only_vgg16},
respectively), our method performs on par with the \emph{budget only} variant
before pruning while being already pruned, up to very high pruning rates (more
than 98\%). On the contrary, and even for ResNet20, the \emph{budget only}
post-pruning variant performs poorly. The \emph{budget only} variant performance
is massively impaired by the \emph{effective pruning} step, even though the
budget is thoroughly respected (\cref{tab:chap1:impact_of_reparametrisation}).
In comparison, our method performs much better than the latter when
\textit{effective pruning} is applied to both methods. The budget loss alone
enforces a stricter adherence to the targeted budget
(\cref{tab:chap1:impact_of_reparametrisation}), however, the lack of
reparametrisation fails to prepare the network for the \emph{effective pruning}
step. Indeed, weights are not soft-pruned and the network is not prepared for
sparsity.\\

The results presented in this comparison and the one of
\cref{sec:chap1:budget_loss} show that both components of our method are of
crucial importance. In particular, the reparametrization allows for a
considerably better generalization of the network after pruning, thus enabling a
much higher level of performance.
\Cref{sec:chap1:impact_of_budget_loss,sec:chap1:impact_of_reparametrisation}
provide empirical evidence that no component of our method can be removed
without significant impairment of the performance, and therefore, they
function in synergy.

\subsection{Tuned Initialisation}
\label{sec:chap1:impact_of_fine_tuning}

% region : finetuning 

Although the method presented in this chapter was designed to circumvent the
need for fine-tuning, it can be used to fine-tune a network trained
conventionally. In this section, we compare the performances of a network
trained in a standard way, then pruned and finally fine-tuned with two methods:
Our method and standard fine-tuning \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanPTD15}. Put simply,
this section describes a process where the initial weights of the network are
not randomly initialised, but are trained and pruned weights. This setup is
evaluated on Conv4, ResNet20 and VGG16 for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The
results are shown in
\cref{fig:chap1:finetuning_impact_conv4,fig:chap1:finetuning_impact_resnet20,fig:chap1:finetuning_impact_vgg6}.
First, a network is trained for 150 epochs on the main classification task. Then
it is pruned up to a specified pruning rate. The pruning criterion used is the
magnitude of the weights where weights with the smallest absolute value are
removed in an unstructured way. The pruned network is then fine-tuned for 300
epochs with an early stopping criterion based on the validation accuracy. The
training is stopped prematurely if the validation accuracy does not improve for
30 epochs. When fine-tuned with our methods, the pruned network is treated as
the original network. The initial latent weights of our method ($\mathbf{w}$)
are the ones of the trained and pruned network. They are reparametrised as in
\ref{sec:chap1:weight_reparam}.\\

Except for results with the Conv4 networks, fine-tuning a network with our
method overperforms the conventional fine-tuning method by a comfortable margin
on ResNet20 across all pruning rates
(\cref{fig:chap1:finetuning_impact_resnet20}) and VGG16
(\cref{fig:chap1:finetuning_impact_vgg6}) for pruning rates higher than 96\%. At
initialisation, the weights of the network are already pruned to the targeted
pruning rate. With the enforcement of the budget through budget loss, the
remaining unpruned weights cannot dwindle to zero, hence preserving all of them
during the fine-tuning process. By contrast, in the absence of budget loss, the
remaining weight values are not restricted, allowing them more freedom to vary
and therefore waste network capacity with weights of small magnitude. The
phenomenon is highlighted by the following experimental results displayed in
\cref{fig:chap1:finetuning_with_init_not_pruned}. This experiment involves a
comparison between two initial setups: one that is only fine-tuned and another
that is both fine-tuned and pruned. The outcomes demonstrate that initialising a
network with both fine-tuned and pruned weights yields significantly superior
results. Moreover, the networks produced by fine-tuning with our method are much
more consistent from one run to another. This is illustrated by the standard
deviation being so small that the colored area around the solid line is barely
visible on the graphs. This is not the case for the conventional fine-tuning
where performances vary greatly from one run to another. This is especially
visible on \cref{fig:chap1:finetuning_impact_conv4_cifar10}.\\

Although the method proposed in this chapter was not initially intended for
fine-tuning networks, it demonstrates superior performance compared to
widely-used standard fine-tuning techniques. Notably, it exhibits enhanced
recovery from the performance decline that occurs following pruning.
Furthermore, the performance consistency of networks fine-tuned with our method
is significantly higher across multiple runs in comparison to networks generated
by traditional fine-tuning methods. The minimal variation observed in the
results indicates increased robustness against the inherent randomness of the
optimization process. Consequently, the final performance is less dependent on
specific initializations, batch orders, or data augmentation seeds than with
standard fine-tuning approaches.\\

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:chap1:conclusion}

% region: conclusion

This chapter introduces a novel approach for pruning neural networks, which
addresses the limitations of conventional pruning pipelines that apply a pruning
criterion and prune networks after an initial training phase without taking into
account the target pruning rate. This often requires a fine-tuning phase to
restore the accuracy loss that follows pruning and the subsequent topology
alteration. In contrast, the proposed method does not require fine-tuning to
achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art magnitude pruning
methods. Experimental evaluations conducted on various datasets and networks
commonly used for image classification benchmarking validate this claim.\\

Our approach described in this chapter consists of two key components: a budget
loss and a weight reparametrisation function. Comparative analyses demonstrate
the importance of both components, as variants without either the budget loss
or the reparametrisation result in inferior performance compared to the
full-fledged method. While the proposed method is designed to avoid
computationally intensive fine-tuning, it can still be used for fine-tuning and
performs comparatively better than standard fine-tuning.\\

The proposed method of this chapter focuses on weight reparametrisation with
budget loss to enhance the network robustness to pruning: compared to a network
trained in the absence of such strategies, our use of reparametrisation and
budget loss substantially mitigates the performance degradation typically
induced by pruning. This forces less useful weights to take small values,
binding the weight value to the network topology. As such, the optimisation
process learns both the weights and topology under the hypothesis that weights
with smaller magnitudes will be removed. This method highlights the importance
of determining the optimal topology in addition to the optimal weights, achieved
in this chapter with the prior that magnitude is a saliency factor for weight
relevance in the topology.\\

Notwithstanding the improved performance of the proposed method compared to
magnitude pruning, it still suffers from some limitations. Namely, the value of
the weight saliency is bound to the reparametrisation which is in turn bound to
the weight value. As a consequence, the weight saliency is only determined by
the latter. The resulting limitation is that the current method cannot treat
weights with the same value (or similar values) differently. Put simply, the
topology is bound to the magnitude of the weights, but not their position in the
network.\\

In the next chapter, the introduced approach seeks to determine the optimal
topology without any prior on the weights and without training them. The
saliency of the initial weights is determined by a trained mask. In other words,
the next method aims at determining the best topology, given a set of weights.
